### [Web Scraping using Python](https://my.ine.com/course/web-scraping-using-python/21153e80-972c-4109-b59f-279775731e73)

# Interacting with websites using Selenium

In this project, you will use Selenium to drive a browser and interact with websites.  During development of your scripts, you may want to use Selenium in the interactive mode to see how a browser responds.  After your code is sufficiently developed, you probably want to switch it to headless mode.

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
